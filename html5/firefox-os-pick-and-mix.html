      Firefox OS uses the browser's rendering engine as the main component to create interfaces.

With Firefox OS, you have predictable browser support, rather than having to support outdated stock browsers and find workarounds.

      Firefox OS is - and this is important to say - not targeting the same markets as iOS and Android. Its main purpose is to bring web connectivity to markets that can't afford other platforms or aren't even supported by them. That's why Firefox OS users are not comparing what you do as App developers to the latest iOS or Android releases. Your job as app developers for Firefox OS is to bring the first impression of the web to lots and lots of new users. Not an easy task, but also a very rewarding one. Instead of copying Angry Birds and not getting the hardware performance you need you could be the new Angry Birds for a totally new audience.

        Firefox OS was created to bring users of feature phones into the web-enabled mobile world. It is meant to cater to the markets not covered by iOS and Android. Yes, you can buy cheap Androids world-wide but the version of Android they support doesn't have an out-of-the-box browser that allows you to do interesting things on the web. Much like Firefox and Opera for Android allow more users world-wide to have a great web experience without having the latest hardware, Firefox OS goes further. Its main goal is to bring millions of new users to the web on their mobile devices without getting a second-grade experience.

      Apps are the hot new thing - except they are not. In essence an app is a thing that does one thing well and is contained in itself. Instead of opening a web site and having it next to many other tabs you open an app and it is the main focus of your attention. People love this. It gives users a catered experience for one task without being distracting. The good news is that the web technologies around HTML5 are flexible enough to cover both cases: you can create a web site but also very easily turn it into an app.

      The main step to turn an HTML5 page/app into a Firefox App is to define an app manifest. These are simple files in JSON defining the name of your app, where the icons are and what permissions you need for the application to work. They need to be sent with the right MIME type on the server and get submitted to the Mozilla marketplace. See them as a quick description of your app.

The first kind is hosted on your own server and has access to a limited amount of extra functionality Firefox OS offers on top of what HTML5 gives you. Privileged apps have much more access to the hardware and must be hosted by Mozilla. Certified apps are part of the operating system and are only built by Mozilla and partners.

        Installing applications from the web is possible by using the open web apps API, which is part of the WebAPI work in Mozilla. You can test if navigator.mozApps is supported and then create a button that calls the install method pointing to the URL of the manifest file of the app to be installed. You then get onsuccess and onerror handlers to deal with the returned objects of the install process. This means that any mobile friendly web site can be turned into an app in a few minutes, and that all the work you put into making your sites found in search engines wasn't wasted, but actually is now advertising for your app.

        Privileged apps have access to more APIs and those dealing with content of more sensitive nature like storing information on the device's file system, accessing the contacts list or loading third party data from the web. To recap, privileged apps need to be packaged up, submitted to the marketplace and delivered from Mozilla's infrastructure. We can not allow just any server on the web to access the user's address book as that would allow the creation of malware in a very easy fashion.

      If you want to access the camera or the address book without packaging your application, there is an alternative called Web Activities. These are much like Web Intents were for Chrome, but more focused on real use cases of the web rather than Android. Using Web Activities you can access the hardware without having to authenticate on the user's behalf. Instead, the users get prompted to use the apps they always use to give you what your app wants.

      <footer class="notes">
        This, as an example, is a call activity. When this JavaScript executes, the user will be sent to the dialer app (or Skype, depending on what app was defined as the default one), the number is sent to the app and the user needs to initiate the call. This is the main difference to WebAPIs - the user has the final say. When the call is denied or the user hung up the phone would go back to your app.

        The 'pick' activity is most probably the most useful one, as it allows you to tell the user that you want something from the device. In this case we define in the MIME type array that we are expecting an image. This would result in the screenshot shown on the right - the user gets asked to give us an image, either from the wallpaper or the photos folder or by taking a new photo with the camera.

      The Firefox OS building blocks are reusable components that make up the apps that are part of the operating system (certified apps). You could say that they are the look and feel of the operating system. They are not, however, built for high-performance apps like social media streams or games. You can use these building blocks to get started but you need to be sure that your app will look like it is part of the operating system, which might confuse end users.
