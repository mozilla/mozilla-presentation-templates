Mozilla presentation templates
==============================

This is the repository with Mozilla styled presentation templates in PPT, Keynote and HTML format. 

There is a screencast showing how to use the Mozilla Evangelism Reps HTML5 slidedeck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_9hf9joTcQ

Changes in this version:

* Fullscreen button (as requested by Stormy Peters)
* Overall cleanup of the CSS (different list styles, live CSS code)
* Pressing "N" in fullscreen mode toggles note display
* In list mode, each slide has a "x" button to turn it on and off. This does not persist though, so when you reload your slides, it will make them all active again (TODO I guess)

Next steps: 

* Persist Toggle slides feature
